# SentimentAnalysis
This is a practice problem on TensorFlow 2.0 Sequential Models Deep Learning on NLP, using the very famous Movie Reviews data for Sentiment Analysis for fun. Also, I am very intrigued by the new Google Colab Free GPU experience and I want to utilize its power for other applications too. Finally, the practice problem itself is very common in NLP and one can find it anywhere but I believe the offered value in this repo is that angle of analysis presented. 

# Model
The model itself has been saved in my_model.h5 so that you would not need to re-train it and you can only just import it. Otherwise, re-running this code should take 15-30 min.

# Output
The output of the classification model is included in this google drive link, feel free to download it and look at the model output.

The minimum prequisite of course is to have anaconda installed on your machine. I personally have it for Python 3.6

The general steps are : 
1- conda create -n tensorflow_env tensorflow
2- Go to Anaconda Navigator / Environments to find the environment called tensorflow_env
3- Go to uninstalled packed and install tensorflow_hub , tensorflow_datasets
4- Go to Home while being on the tensorflow_env environment and install jupyterlab
5- launch jupyter notebook
