# SentimentAnalysis
This is a practice problem on Sequential Models Deep Learning on NLP, using the very famous Movie Reviews data for Sentiment Analysis for fun. Also, I am very intrigued by the new Google Colab Free GPU experience and I want to utilize its power for other applications too. Finally, the practice problem itself is very common in NLP and one can find it anywhere but I believe the offered value in this repo is that angle of analysis presented.
