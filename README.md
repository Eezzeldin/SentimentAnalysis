# SentimentAnalysis
This is a practice problem on TensorFlow 2.0 Sequential Models Deep Learning on NLP, using the very famous Movie Reviews data for Sentiment Analysis for fun. Also, I am very intrigued by the new Google Colab Free GPU experience and I want to utilize its power for other applications too. Finally, the practice problem itself is very common in NLP and one can find it anywhere but I believe the offered value in this repo is that angle of analysis presented. 

# Model
The model itself has been saved in my_model.h5 so that you would not need to re-train it and you can only just import it. 

# Output
The output of the classification model is included in this google drive link, feel free to download it and look at the model output.
